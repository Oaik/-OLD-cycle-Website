        <h2 class="center">MAKING HISTORY</h2>
        <p class="center">In 2012, four American women made history. Sarah Hammer, Dotsie Bausch, Lauren Tamayo and Jennie Reed rode their FELT BICYCLES TK track bikes to the silver medal in the women’s team pursuit on the world stage. But shortly after that monumental result, and inspired by the efforts of those American women, racing fans began to question if a victory could be within reach of the USA Cycling Team. Now, as the USA Women’s Pursuit Cycling Team prepares for the season, FELT BICYCLES has the answer. <span>Meet the TA FRD (Track Aero | Felt Racing Development).</span></p>

                <p class="left">The initial discussion for this project began four years ago. We looked at the success that our U.S. women had in London taking the silver medal behind Great Britain and asked ourselves, what’s it going to take to win, and to beat Great Britain and the rest of the world’s top teams in 2016? We wanted Felt’s expertise to help us go one better.</p>

                <p class="center left">The goal was clearly defined, and that was a gold medal in Rio. The question for us was, how do we improve our current model and create the fastest track bike in history?</p>

                <p>When it was first unveiled 8 years ago, the TK1 was the most advanced track bike that FELT BICYCLES had ever produced. And its incredible versatility made it a capable sprint bike, points bike and pursuit bike. But as Jeff Soucek, Director of Engineering at FELT BICYCLES, notes, “The only way to make something the absolute best it can be is to be really focused on it.” To aid the athletes of the USA Cycling Team, FELT engineers started with a clean sheet of paper and narrowed the project down. It would strictly be a team pursuit bike ridden by the athletes of the USA Cycling Team. From an engineering standpoint, that focus allowed them to create the purest race bike in existence.</p>
